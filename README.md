🏥 Health Predictor - AI-Powered Disease Prediction
Author: AKash Mishra
Technologies: Django, Machine Learning (ML), Python, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap
ML Model:  Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM.
Deployment: In Progress (using GitHub + Render/Vercel)

📌 Project Overview
Health Predictor is an AI-based disease prediction system that analyzes user symptoms to predict possible diseases. Built using Django and machine learning, it aims to provide quick and accurate preliminary health assessments.

🎯 Features
✅ User-friendly UI (Django + Bootstrap)
✅ Predicts diseases based on input symptoms
✅ Uses an ML model for accurate predictions
✅ Secure authentication system
✅ Deployed on (Render/Vercel – Update once completed)

🛠 Technologies & Tools Used
Backend: Django, Python

Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

Machine Learning Model:  Random Forest, Logistic Regression

Database: SQLite/PostgreSQL

Deployment: GitHub + Render/Vercel (Work in Progress)
